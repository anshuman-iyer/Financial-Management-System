Author: Anshuman Iyer

📖 Overview
This is a straightforward, console-based Financial Management application written in C++. It allows users to track their income and expenses through a simple command-line interface. All transaction data is saved locally to a transactions.txt file, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

The application provides core functionalities for personal finance tracking, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting transactions, as well as generating a summary of financial activity.

✨ Features
Add Transaction: Add new income or expense records with details like date, category, amount, and a description.

View All Transactions: Display a neatly formatted table of all recorded transactions.

Update Transaction: Modify the details of an existing transaction by its unique ID.

Delete Transaction: Remove a transaction from the records using its ID.

Financial Summary: Get a quick overview of total income, total expenses, and the remaining balance. It also provides a breakdown of expenses by category.

Data Persistence: Transactions are automatically loaded from and saved to a local file (transactions.txt), so your data is always there when you restart the application.

Input Validation: Includes basic checks to ensure the user enters valid choices and data formats.
